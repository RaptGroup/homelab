# `kubernetes/apps/homepage/`

Cluster dashboard at `dashboard.lab.jackhall.dev`
([gethomepage.dev](https://gethomepage.dev/)). Auto-discovers other
addons via `gethomepage.dev/*` annotations on their `HTTPRoute`s
(PRD #4 / issue #14).

## Routed vs. headless: where service entries live

Two card-source paths exist, picked per-addon by whether it has an
`HTTPRoute`:

- **Routed addon** — the addon has an `HTTPRoute` for browser traffic.
  Its card is configured via `gethomepage.dev/*` annotations on that
  route, picked up by Homepage's `config.kubernetes.gateway: true`
  discovery loop. The addon owns its card, in its own directory; this
  helm-values file stays out of the way.

- **Headless addon** — no `HTTPRoute`, because the addon serves no
  HTTP at all (ARC runners, ARC controller). Homepage cannot
  auto-discover these — its discovery loop only scans `HTTPRoute`,
  `Ingress`, and Traefik `IngressRoute` objects, not arbitrary
  `Service`s. The card is therefore declared longhand under
  `services:` in `helm-values.yaml` here. Cluster signals (pod count,
  status pill) ride on `namespace` + `podSelector` fields against the
  addon's own namespace.

The CI group's two cards (`RaptGroup runners`, `Brazostech runners`)
are the live examples of the headless path. Don't add routed addons
to `helm-values.yaml` just because it's easier — duplicating the
annotation pattern there breaks the "one source of truth per card"
property that makes the dashboard reviewable.

## Status-discovery overrides

Homepage's K8s status lookup defaults to a pod with
`app.kubernetes.io/name=<HTTPRoute name>` in the HTTPRoute's namespace.
When the default doesn't match a real pod the card renders **NOT
FOUND** *and* the Homepage Deployment logs `<kubernetesStatusService>
no pods found …` on every dashboard load. Three escape hatches:

| Annotation                          | Effect                                                                |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `gethomepage.dev/app`               | Overrides the *value* matched against `app.kubernetes.io/name=`       |
| `gethomepage.dev/pod-selector`      | Replaces the selector entirely — any K8s label selector expression    |
| `gethomepage.dev/external`          | `"true"` skips the K8s status lookup entirely (plain link)            |

The widget side has its own pair: `gethomepage.dev/widget.app` swaps
the value for the kubernetes widget's lookup,
`gethomepage.dev/widget.podSelector` (note the camelCase — Homepage
maps `widget.*` annotations directly onto the widget config object)
replaces it with a full selector expression. Pick `pod-selector` /
`widget.podSelector` when the *label key itself* is wrong, e.g. when
a chart names every workload `app.kubernetes.io/name=<chart>` and
puts per-component identity on the bare `app=` label.

Cross-namespace lookups are not expressible on HTTPRoutes. Homepage
v1.2.0 honors `gethomepage.dev/namespace` on `Ingress` objects only;
on HTTPRoutes the annotation is silently ignored. When the backing
Deployment lives in a different namespace from the HTTPRoute, set
`gethomepage.dev/external: "true"` instead — the Homepage UI renders
the K8s status pill only when `service.app && !service.external`
(`src/components/services/item.jsx`), so `external` short-circuits
both the pill render and the underlying pod lookup.

Live examples in this repo:

- `kubernetes/apps/adguard-home/manifests/httproute.yaml` — HTTPRoute
  is `adguard-home-ui` but the bjw-s app-template renders the
  Deployment as `adguard-home`, so the route sets
  `gethomepage.dev/app: adguard-home`.
- `kubernetes/apps/hubble-ui/manifests/httproute.yaml` — the Cilium
  chart installs the Hubble UI Deployment into `kube-system`, not the
  `hubble-ui` namespace where this repo owns the routing layer. Since
  Homepage can't be told to look in another namespace from an
  HTTPRoute, the route sets `gethomepage.dev/external: "true"`; the
  Hubble card renders as a plain link with no status pill and the
  Homepage Deployment stops emitting pod-lookup errors for it.
- `kubernetes/apps/longhorn/manifests/httproute.yaml` — the upstream
  Longhorn chart sets `app.kubernetes.io/name=longhorn` uniformly on
  every workload (`longhorn-ui`, `longhorn-manager`, the `csi-*`
  components), with per-component identity on the bare `app=` label.
  `gethomepage.dev/app` couldn't reach a per-component pod, so the
  route sets `gethomepage.dev/pod-selector: app=longhorn-ui` for the
  status pill and `gethomepage.dev/widget.podSelector:
  app=longhorn-manager` for the kubernetes widget's DaemonSet
  lookup.

When adding a new addon: if the HTTPRoute's `metadata.name` matches the
backing Deployment's `app.kubernetes.io/name` *and* both live in the
same namespace, no override is needed. If the names differ but the
namespace matches, set `gethomepage.dev/app`. If the chart uses the
same `app.kubernetes.io/name` value across multiple workloads (so
swapping the value can't disambiguate), set
`gethomepage.dev/pod-selector` to a selector expression that targets
the specific workload's labels. If the Deployment lives in a
different namespace from the HTTPRoute, set
`gethomepage.dev/external: "true"` rather than restructuring the repo
to satisfy Homepage's HTTPRoute discovery limitations. Reference:

## Shape

```
kubernetes/apps/homepage/
├── application.yaml            # multi-source ArgoCD Application
├── helm-values.yaml            # jameswynn/homepage values

    └── httproute.yaml          # dashboard.lab.jackhall.dev → homepage Service (attaches to the central `lab` Gateway)
```

Exposed via the central `lab` Gateway in `gateway-system` (issue #48);
the Gateway itself is owned by `kubernetes/apps/lab-gateway/`. The
HTTPRoute attaches cross-namespace via `parentRefs.namespace:
gateway-system` and TLS termination + wildcard-cert handling happens
there, not in this namespace.

## Widget credentials

Live-status widgets (currently AdGuard Home and ArgoCD) need credentials
to call each addon's API. Per the homelab convention, those credentials
live in GSM and are synced into a K8s Secret by ESO; nothing sensitive
lives in Git or in helm-values.

The three GSM containers are TF-managed in `terraform/gcp/main.tf`
(mirroring `talos-cluster-secrets`, `argocd-repo-ssh-key`, and
`adguard-home-admin`); only the *values* are uploaded out of band.

| GSM secret ID                | Purpose                                                     |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `homepage-adguard-username`  | Plaintext AdGuard admin username                            |
| `homepage-adguard-password`  | Plaintext AdGuard admin password                            |
| `homepage-argocd-token`      | ArgoCD readonly account API token                           |

The `homepage-widget-credentials` `ExternalSecret` reads these and
projects them as `HOMEPAGE_VAR_ADGUARD_USERNAME`,
`HOMEPAGE_VAR_ADGUARD_PASSWORD`, and `HOMEPAGE_VAR_ARGOCD_TOKEN` env
vars on the Homepage Deployment, which the addon `HTTPRoute`
annotations reference as `{{HOMEPAGE_VAR_…}}` substitutions.

> **Plaintext vs. bcrypt — why two AdGuard secrets exist.**
> `adguard-home-admin` (consumed by `kubernetes/apps/adguard-home/`)
> stores `{username, password_hash}` where `password_hash` is the
> *bcrypt* of the admin password — that is what AdGuard's
> `AdGuardHome.yaml` requires. Homepage's AdGuard widget, however,
> authenticates against the live admin API and therefore needs the
> *plaintext* password. So `homepage-adguard-username` /
> `homepage-adguard-password` and the bcrypt half of
> `adguard-home-admin` must point at the **same actual credential** —
> if you rotate the AdGuard admin password, update both places or the
> dashboard widget will start returning auth errors.

## First-install flow

1. **Decide the AdGuard credential first.** `kubernetes/apps/adguard-home/`
   establishes the AdGuard admin user; the same plaintext password feeds
   step 3 below. See that addon's README for the bcrypt step.

2. **Mint the ArgoCD readonly-account token.** The `homepage` local
   account and its `role:readonly` RBAC binding are declared in
   `kubernetes/bootstrap/argocd/values.yaml` (`configs.cm.accounts.homepage`
   + `configs.rbac.policy.csv`), so the chart provisions both on every
   reconcile. The token itself is *not* in Git — it's minted out-of-band
   against the live cluster, since ArgoCD only stores the account
   declaration, not its credentials:

   ```sh
   argocd login argocd.lab.jackhall.dev
   argocd account generate-token --account homepage
   ```

   Sanity check first if the account doesn't appear in the UI's User
   Info page (e.g. right after a fresh bootstrap, before Argo has
   reconciled the chart):

   ```sh
   kubectl -n argocd get cm argocd-cm -o yaml | grep accounts.homepage
   # → accounts.homepage: apiKey
   # → accounts.homepage.enabled: "true"
   kubectl -n argocd get cm argocd-rbac-cm -o yaml | grep -A1 policy.csv
   # → policy.csv: |
   # →   g, homepage, role:readonly
   ```

   The `apiKey` capability (vs. `login`) is deliberate: the account can
   mint API tokens but cannot log in to the UI, bounding a leaked token
   to API reads only.

3. **Upload the three values to GSM.** The containers are pre-provisioned
   by `terraform/gcp/`:

   ```sh
   echo -n '<adguard-admin-username>' | gcloud secrets versions add \
     homepage-adguard-username \
     --project rockingham-homelab --data-file=-

   echo -n '<adguard-admin-password>' | gcloud secrets versions add \
     homepage-adguard-password \
     --project rockingham-homelab --data-file=-

   echo -n '<argocd-readonly-api-token>' | gcloud secrets versions add \
     homepage-argocd-token \
     --project rockingham-homelab --data-file=-
   ```

   `echo -n` matters — a trailing newline becomes part of the secret
   value and breaks API auth.

   ESO's `ClusterSecretStore gsm` syncs the values into the
   `homepage-widget-credentials` K8s Secret in the `homepage` namespace
   within `refreshInterval` (1h).

4. **Sync the Application.** ArgoCD picks `homepage` up from the root
   app-of-apps automatically. First sync brings up:

   - the `homepage` Deployment (envFrom mounts
     `homepage-widget-credentials` as `HOMEPAGE_VAR_*`),
   - the `homepage` Service on port 3000,
   - the `HTTPRoute` for `dashboard.lab.jackhall.dev`, attaching to the
     central `lab` Gateway in `gateway-system`.

   AdGuard's seed wildcard rewrite (`*.lab.jackhall.dev → 192.168.1.201`)
   resolves `dashboard.lab.jackhall.dev` to the central Gateway by
   construction — no per-host AdGuard rewrite is needed.

5. **Verify.** Once the device is using AdGuard Home for resolution
   (per `kubernetes/apps/adguard-home/README.md`):

   ```sh
   curl -I https://dashboard.lab.jackhall.dev   # → HTTP/2 200, valid LE cert
   ```

   The dashboard should render with cards for itself, AdGuard, ArgoCD,
   and Hubble UI auto-discovered from their `HTTPRoute` annotations.

## Rotating credentials

To rotate the ArgoCD token: mint a new one against the live cluster,
then push it to GSM:

```sh
argocd login argocd.lab.jackhall.dev
argocd account generate-token --account homepage | tr -d '\n' | \
  gcloud secrets versions add homepage-argocd-token \
    --project rockingham-homelab --data-file=-
```

ESO picks up the new value on the next refresh and the Homepage pod's
env vars update on the next pod restart (chart `restartPods` helper or a
manual rollout). Old tokens stay valid until explicitly revoked via
`argocd account delete-token --account homepage <id>`.

To rotate the AdGuard password: rotate the plaintext password in
AdGuard's admin UI, recompute the bcrypt hash, then update **both**
GSM secrets in lockstep — `adguard-home-admin` (the JSON object with
the new bcrypt hash) and `homepage-adguard-password` (the new
plaintext). See `kubernetes/apps/adguard-home/README.md` for the
bcrypt recipe.

## Disaster recovery

Homepage is stateless — its config is rendered from `helm-values.yaml`
on every pod start and the dashboard's data comes from live cluster
queries plus the widget API calls. Re-running the first-install flow
(steps 2–6 above) is the entire DR procedure; the only state worth
keeping is the GSM credentials, which are already off-machine.
